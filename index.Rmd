## Hello, I'm Lennart!

I like to extract knowledge from data and live my passion as a Research Associate in the Econometrics Group at Bielefeld University.

You can download my CV [here](cv/oelschlaeger.pdf).

In my spare time you can find me above the clouds, on the tennis court, or in front of a chess board.
